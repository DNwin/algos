# Algos
This repository contains some common data structure and algorithm problems. 

There can be multiple solutions to each problem. Each solution should include Big-O time and space analysis.

If you see any mistakes, please feel free to submit a pull request.

## Structure

Every algorithm problem should be contained in its own class if applicable. 
Each class should contain a `main` function that performs an `assert` on each return value using test input.

## Enabling Assertions

### Command Line
`java -ea <program_name>`

### Intellj IDEA
In the top menu, press Run > Edit Configurations > Defaults > Application > VM options.
To enable the assertion feature for all applications, fill the VM options with `-ea`
